What did you learn from doing this lab?

I was reminded how you can use methods outside of a class and how they can be useful.

What did you find challenging about the lab?

Not much.

What would you recommend changing if this lab is reused in future years?

If the goal is for us to learn about classes, we should be forced to do more on our own. I felt very handheld throughout this lab.
